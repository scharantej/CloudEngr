## Flask Application to Craft a Dating App for Engineers

### Problem Analysis
The objective is to create a dating app for engineers that offers seamless integration with an engineering calculator. This application should not only facilitate connections between potential matches but also enable collaboration on technical projects and foster intellectually stimulating conversations. The user interface should be tailored to the specific needs of engineers and provide a platform to assess compatibility, exchange knowledge, and develop meaningful relationships.

### Flask Application Design
**HTML Files**
1. **index.html**: This file serves as the landing page for the application. It includes:
    - A login form for existing users.
    - A signup form for new users.
2. **dashboard.html**: After successful login, users are redirected to the dashboard. It contains:
    - A user profile section displaying basic information.
    - A section for sending messages to other users.
    - A section for accessing the engineering calculator.
3. **calculator.html**: This file displays the engineering calculator. It allows users to perform:
    - Mathematical operations (e.g., addition, subtraction, multiplication, division).
    - Unit conversions.
    - Complex engineering calculations (e.g., stress analysis, fluid dynamics).

**Routes**
1. **login**: This route handles user login and redirects successful users to the dashboard.
2. **signup**: This route handles user registration and authenticates new users.
3. **dashboard**: This route serves the dashboard page to authenticated users.
4. **send_message**: This route allows users to send messages to other users.
5. **calculator**: This route serves the engineering calculator page to authenticated users.

### Implementation Details
- The user authentication mechanism (e.g., storing user credentials) is left to the developer's implementation, as it may vary based on the chosen database.
- The engineering calculator functionality can be implemented using a third-party library or custom code.
- The user interface's design and specific features can be customized to enhance the user experience.
